# Currency Converter in Java

This project was developed as part of my learning in Java and consumption of REST APIs. The application allows you to convert values ​​between different currencies, consult the exchange rate table based on a selected currency, as well as keep a history of the conversions made, all from the terminal.
O projeto utiliza a [ExchangeRate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) para obter os dados atualizados das taxas de câmbio.

I'm always looking to evolve as a developer, so any feedback about the project, code, organization or best practices will be very welcome! If you want to contribute with suggestions, you can:
